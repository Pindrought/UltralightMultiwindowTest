The purpose of this repository is a minimal code sample for reproducing what **might** be a possible memory leak within Ultralight, but is not confirmed as it could also be related to how the memory is allocated/managed.

**I would strongly advise against ever using GetAsyncKeyState() for detecting input for an application.**
